    Dear Addressee,

    We regret to inform you that we are unable to offer you a place at Hogwarts
    School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After reviewing your application and
    Github profile, we recognize that you are indeed a "coding wizard".
    Unfortunately, we have concluded that you do not have actual magical
    abilities, which you must have to be admitted into Hogwarts.

    Your sincerely,

    Minerva McGonagall
    Deputy Headmistress"
