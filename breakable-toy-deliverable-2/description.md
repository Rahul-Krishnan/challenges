CartSpot/FoodTrucker: Food Truck Tracker
========================================
The City of Boston has an easily accessible simple food truck schedule. I would like to integrate this with Google Maps so you can search for nearby food trucks at any time of day and set up alerts for your favorite spots. You should be able to search for food trucks based on location and time of day. I believe the Google Maps API will also allow users to look up directions to the carts using various means of transport. Eventually, there should be user reviews and a searchable map a la Yelp.

To make things more accurate, I also want to incorporate Twitter updates. Many of the trucks in Boston update their location on their Twitter page in real time, so a location tweet from a food truck should override the city's posted schedule. Alerts can be sent to users via Twitter, email, Facebook and text message.
