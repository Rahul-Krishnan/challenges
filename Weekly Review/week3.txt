What have we learned?

Ruby classes
-initialize
-def initialize method
-can take arguments
-instance variables out of arguments
-methods

Inheritance
-classes can inherit from other classes
-overwrite: if we define a method in a child class, it overwrites the parent class
-can call super in a child class to refer to parent class property

Modules
-can include or extend
  include: instance methods
  extend: class methods

Exceptions
-can raise a custom error class that inherits from StandardError class
-can catch them and bypass them
-rescue

TDD
-Build tests first
-Red, Green, Refactor

APIs
-Application Programming Interfaces
-Key Authentication (DO NOT push to github)
-Gems like HTTParty to make calls
-Responses--JSON, XML, SOAP
-Parse JSON, manipulate data
-Look at the documentation

ARGV
-Allows you to store command line arguments as an array

*** MAKE SURE YOU CAN DO OOP MARATHON, RSPEC TESTING, TDD, APIs ***
