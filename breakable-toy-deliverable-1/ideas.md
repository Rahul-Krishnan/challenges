# Breakable Toy Ideas
3 Main ideas, plus a few more at the bottom of my shortlist:

CartSpot/FoodTrucker: Food Truck Tracker 
========================================
The City of Boston has an easily accessible simple food truck schedule. I would like to integrate this with Google Maps so you can search for nearby food trucks at any time of day. The first step will be to pull the data and display a text list of all currently open food trucks (with addresses). Once that works, I can start using the Google Maps API for more interesting features. You should be able to search for food trucks based on your current location or any arbitrary location. Once I have that, I would like to add search functionality for any arbitrary time of day. I believe the Google Maps API will also allow users to look up directions to the carts using various means of transport.


H2G2 Skin for Wikipedia + Actual Guide
======================================
As a lover of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, I have been disappointed by the presentation of the Guide on the internet. I would like to create a website that closely mimics the look and feel of the Guide as described in the books. This will involve significant visual features, including animated cover and page turning effects. For content, I would like to have 3 options:

- Entries from Wikipedia
- Entries from H2G2 fan site
- Combination of both of the above (where H2G2 wins in any entry conflicts)

The combo of entries would, in my estimation, most closely resemble the Hitchhiker's Guide as described by Douglas Adams. I will likely have to start with just Wikipedia and its API.


"Worst reviews" collection- Yelp, Opentable, Google, etc
========================================================
Everyone loves to stare at a good wreck, and product reviews are no different. I propose creating a site that compiles all the 0, 1 and 2-star reviews on various review sites. Users can then rate these entries by hilarity. There can be a 'best of the worst' section that highlights the user-selected funniest reviews. I will start out just combining reviews, and will add user functionality later. This kind of site is quite open-ended in terms of visual design and additional features.



Other ideas I'm toying with (mostly self-explanatory)
=====================================================
- QR Code Scanner
- Trumpslator
- Sheet music reader & player
- HTTP Status guinea pigs
- Multilingual swearing

I'd love to use one of the newer Augmented Reality APIs available (eg wikitude, ARtoolkit), but that may be too involved for a two-week project.
